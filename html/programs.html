            For orphaned and underprivileged children, education is not just a need; itâ€™s a lifeline to a brighter future. It provides the skills, knowledge, and confidence that children need to break free from the cycle of poverty and hardship. By equipping these young minds with the right tools, we help pave the way for them to become responsible, successful adults who can contribute positively to society.We fund academic programs, develop educational facilities, and supply learning materials to various orphanages and schools.</div>

        <h2>Shelter</h2>

        <div class="shelter">
            The plight of orphaned children is heart-wrenching. Many face abandonment, neglect, and the harsh reality of life without basic necessities or parental guidance.
Being deprived of education, shelter, and a loving environment, these children start their lives at a disadvantage that often sets the course for their future.

At the Orphan Life Foundation, we believe every child deserves a fair chance at a fulfilling life. This core belief fuels our Orphan Lifestyle Programs, aimed at directly improving the quality of life for orphans.

            To collect and distribute usable clothing and shoes to needy orphans, primarily targeting communities where children face extreme weather conditions without proper clothing.We provide weather-appropriate clothes and shoes to the needy through an all-volunteer, non-profit program so they can cover themselves and live with dignity.From 2018-2023, we raised over $1700 to distribute clothing and shoes to two orphanages and five orphan schools in Didyr. Our future goal is to raise $2,500 to help more schools and orphanages.
